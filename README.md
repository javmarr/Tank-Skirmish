# Tips:
* Use the items hidden in some bricks to find victory.
* Rockets are strong but limited; use bullets when out of rockets.
* Bullets are better for breaking walls and getting items, Rockets do more damage so save them for your opponent
* Shields protect from one rocket or 5 bullets// use it to your advantage
